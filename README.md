## Technology Stack

### 1. Django
Django is a high-level web framework for building web applications quickly and efficiently. It follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern and helps in developing RESTful APIs.

### 2. MySQL
MySQL is a relational database management system that stores application data in a structured format. It provides powerful querying capabilities and ensures data integrity.

### 3. GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need. It allows for more efficient data retrieval compared to traditional REST APIs.

### 4. Docker
Docker is a containerization platform that allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into containers. This ensures consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment.

### 5. GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that automates workflows directly in GitHub. It helps in building, testing, and deploying applications automatically, enhancing development efficiency.

### 6. Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides pre-designed components and styles for building responsive web interfaces. It helps in creating a visually appealing user experience.

### 7. Nginx
Nginx is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy. It efficiently handles client requests and serves static content, improving application performance.

### 8. Redis
Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It enhances application performance by providing fast data access and temporary storage.
